Single view with actions combined
=================================

Sometimes with htmx you may have one view to render the whole page, and separate
views to manage any POST actions (see the `toggle_with_separate_partials and
toggle_item view functions <./code/htmx_patterns/views/partials.py>`_ for an
example of this). Sometimes, however, it is more convenient and logical to
define those actions with a single view.

The pattern I use here is almost identical to the code I would write if I wasn’t
using htmx at all. Consider a page that shows an item, and has a couple of
buttons to control it - first without htmx:

View code:

.. code-block:: python

   def monster_detail(request: HttpRequest, monster_id: int):
       monster: Monster = get_object_or_404(Monster.objects.all(), id=monster_id)

       if request.method == "POST":
           if "kick" in request.POST:
               monster.kick()
           elif "hug" in request.POST:
               monster.hug()
           return HttpResponseRedirect("")

       return TemplateResponse(
           request,
           "monster_detail.html",
           {
               "monster": monster,
           },
       )


Notice how we can have multiple actions, as above, by detecting different
parameters present in the POST request. The HTML to make this work simply needs
a POST form with two ``<button type=submit>`` or ``<input type="submit">``
elements with different ``name`` attributes (because the clicked button’s
``name`` attribute will be included in the POST data):

.. code-block:: html

    <form
      method="POST"
      action=""
      >
      {% csrf_token %}
      {% if monster.is_happy %}
        <p>{{ monster.name }} is happy.</p>
        <button name="kick" type="submit">Kick it!</button>
      {% else %}
        <p>{{ monster.name }} is sad.</p>
        <button name="hug" type="submit">Hug it!</button>
      {% endif %}

    </form>


Here, the available button actions depend on the current ``is_happy`` state, and
are mutually exclusive, but that doesn’t have to be the case.

Nice things about this include:

- less “wiring” between different views. You can just do ``action=""``,
  ``hx-post=""``, and ``HttpResponseRedirect("")`` and everything gets
  posted/redirected to the same URL.

  Often you will see ``"."`` instead of the empty URL "". The only difference is
  that the relative URL ``.`` represents the current path **without query
  parameters**, so it will cause the query string to be stripped, which you may
  or may not want, while the empty URL (sometimes spelled as a single space in
  ``action=" "``) includes the whole of the current location.

- Less boilerplate and repetition of the initial parts of the view function.

- The single “page” is represented by a single view function.

To htmx-ify this, we have a few very small tweaks to make:

* In the template, add some blocks (or partials) for the parts we need to render separately.
* In the template, add some ``hx-`` attributes
* Don’t do a redirect for htmx requests
* For the htmx POST request, render a part of the template.

Here I will do this using our previous `for_htmx decorator with inline partials <./inline_partials.rst>`_ pattern.

New view code:

.. code-block:: python

   @for_htmx(use_block_from_params=True)
   def monster_detail(request: HttpRequest, monster_id: int):
       monster: Monster = get_object_or_404(Monster.objects.all(), id=monster_id)

       if request.method == "POST":
           if "kick" in request.POST:
               monster.kick()
           elif "hug" in request.POST:
               monster.hug()
           if not is_htmx(request):
               return HttpResponseRedirect("")

       return TemplateResponse(
           request,
           "monster_detail.html",
           {
               "monster": monster,
           },
       )


New HTML:

.. code-block:: html

  {% block monster-form %}
    <form
      method="POST"
      action=""
      id="monster-form"
      hx-post=""
      hx-target="#monster-form"
      hx-swap="outerHTML"
      hx-vals='{"use_block": "monster-form"}'
      >
      {% csrf_token %}
      {% if monster.is_happy %}
        <p>{{ monster.name }} is happy.</p>
        <button name="kick" type="submit">Kick it!</button>
      {% else %}
        <p>{{ monster.name }} is sad.</p>
        <button name="hug" type="submit">Hug it!</button>

      {% endif %}

    </form>
  {% endblock %}


Here, I’ve also ensured that the page continues to work even if the htmx library doesn’t load client side.
