Django + htmx patterns
======================

This repo is a rough-and-ready compilation of the patterns I’m using and
developing when writing `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ projects that
use `htmx <https://htmx.org/>`_, with complete example code.

The docs are intended to be viewed on GitHub:
https://github.com/spookylukey/django-htmx-patterns/ and the code can be run
locally if needed.

My aims are to document and share:

1. The basic patterns and control flow needed
2. Some enhancements we can make with a few utilities

The code presented depends only on Django and htmx, unless otherwise noted. I
won’t be packaging it up as a library. It is instead being released into the
public domain, and you are encouraged to copy-paste it for your own needs. (See
the “Approach” docs for why).

There are some Django packages that provide shortcuts for some of the things
mentioned here, such as `django-htmx
<https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx>`_, but I won’t be using any of them
for the sake of clarity.

This is a work in progress, I’ll try to keep it up to date. PRs welcome.

tl;dr
-----

The biggest contributions in this repo are:

* `inline partials with block selection in the template
  <https://github.com/spookylukey/django-htmx-patterns/blob/master/inline_partials.rst#block-selection-in-the-template>`_.

  This is a pattern which allows you to keep the parts of the page together for
  great “locality of behaviour”, and avoid the view code having to know anything
  about which template fragments/partials are being used. Template code changes
  for htmx are usually a matter of wrapping some parts of a template in a Django
  template ``block`` and adding standard htmx attributes. View code changes for
  htmx are often just adding a single decorator on the view function:
  ``@for_htmx(use_block_from_params=True)``.

  This pattern makes a huge difference to htmx usability in Django.

Requirements
------------

* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
* `htmx <https://htmx.org/>`_ (see `Base template <./base_template.rst>`_ for suggested installation docs)
* The nicest patterns here require `django-render-block <https://github.com/clokep/django-render-block>`_::

    pip install django-render-block


Monsters
--------

My example code includes sad and happy monsters that can be hugged or kicked to
change their state. Please note that I do not endorse the kicking of monsters,
nor advise hugging them.


Code folder
-----------

In the `code folder <./code/>`_ is a demo app which has full working examples of
everything in the docs.

To install locally, create and activate a virtualenv, and then do::

  cd code
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py runserver
